# TODO LIST

+ [ ] manhattan plot for enriched result
  - figure 1 of <https://f1000research.com/articles/9-709>
+ [ ] Circos plot for expression prifile and pathway annotation
  - Fig 2 of <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14802-2>
  - maybe a cartisian coordination version, i.e. a heatmap with a dot table to indicate the pathways belong.
+ [ ] plot enriched terms as a tree
  - hc(1-sim), where sim is calculated by GOSemSim, and visualize by ggtree
  - label clade with representative words
+ [ ] plot gene expression profile by PCA (or other methods) and label clusters with representative words
